This website is initiated during the [DAPS 2nd workshop: Applying and comparing
proxy system models and data assimilation methods](http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/daps/meetings/127-pages/1835-2nd-daps-wshop-19)
organized by [Michael N. Evans](mailto: mnevans@umd.edu) from 29-31 May 2019 in College Park, MD, USA. It aims to identify what
resources the broader community needs and form a central repository for those resources.
